## Section 2: The Quiz - "How Needy Are You?"

**Heading:** The Quiz: How Needy Are You? Unmask Your Inner Archetype.

**Introduction:** In a world that often rewards dependence, understanding your own tendencies is the first step towards radical self-reliance. This isn't about judgment; it's about diagnosis. Our "How Needy Are You?" quiz is engineered to cut through the self-deception and reveal your dominant archetype in the battle against neediness. Are you unknowingly sabotaging your strength? Or are you already on the path to becoming a quiet savage? The truth can be brutal, but it's also liberating. Prepare for an unflinching look in the mirror.

**(Placeholder for Interactive Quiz - Initial Static Content):**

The full interactive quiz experience is being forged in the fires of development and will be unleashed soon. Until then, familiarize yourself with the archetypes. Which one resonates most with your current state? Honesty is paramount.

*   **The Victim:** "Life happens *to* me." This archetype sees hardship as a personal affront, a never-ending series of injustices. They seek pity, not solutions, and often find comfort in their perceived powerlessness. The world is a conspiracy against them, and every setback confirms their narrative. *Suggested Path: Foundational content on responsibility and agency.*
*   **The Blamer:** "It's always *someone else's* fault." A close cousin to The Victim, The Blamer deflects all responsibility. Bosses are incompetent, partners are unsupportive, the system is rigged. They expend enormous energy identifying external scapegoats, leaving none for self-improvement. *Suggested Path: Content focused on radical ownership and internal locus of control.*
*   **The Grit:** "I will *endure* and *overcome*." This individual possesses a nascent toughness. They face adversity, sometimes stumble, but always get back up. They understand hard work and perseverance but may lack the strategic ruthlessness or emotional detachment of a true savage. They are strong, but perhaps not yet wise to the game. *Suggested Path: Advanced tactics for emotional resilience and strategic thinking.*
*   **The Quiet Savage:** "I *control* what I can, and *disregard* what I cannot." This is the embodiment of mental fortitude and emotional independence. The Quiet Savage operates from a position of internal strength, unswayed by external chaos or approval. They are self-reliant, strategically minded, and emotionally resilient. They don't broadcast their strength; they live it. *Suggested Path: Content on leadership, legacy, and mentoring others.*

**Call to Action (while quiz is placeholder):** "Identify Your Starting Point. The Full Arsenal Arrives Soon."
